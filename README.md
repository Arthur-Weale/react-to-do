# Overview

his project is a full-stack MERN-style To-Do application built to strengthen my skills as a software engineer. The goal was to practice building a complete workflow: setting up an Express server, connecting to MongoDB, building CRUD operations through a REST API, and integrating it with a React frontend. This helped me deepen my understanding of backend architecture, API design, state management in React, and handling real-world data flow from client to server and database.

The software allows users to:

Create new to-do items

View all stored to-dos

Update completion status using a checkbox

Delete items

Store all data persistently using MongoDB

The purpose of creating this software was to improve my full-stack development confidence by building a working app that uses essential industry concepts: routing, controllers, models, environment variables, React hooks, and RESTful API communication.

# Development Environment

This project was developed using the following tools:

Node.js – for running the backend JavaScript environment

Express.js – for creating the REST API and routing

MongoDB & Mongoose – for database storage and schema modeling

React (Vite) – for the frontend UI and component-based rendering

Nodemon – for automatically restarting the backend during development

VS Code – as the main development editor

Postman (optional) – for endpoint testing

Programming languages used:

JavaScript (ES Modules) for both frontend and backend

JSX for React components

JSON for API communication
